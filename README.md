## 🧠 Key Concepts

GitHub is a platform that helps developers store and share code, track changes, and collaborate with others. Think of it like Google Docs — but for code.

### 1. **Repository**
A **repository** (or "repo") is like a folder for your project. It contains all the files, images, and code you’re working on.

> Example: A folder called `my-website` with your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

---

### 2. **Commit**
A **commit** is like taking a snapshot of your code. It saves your changes so you can go back to them later.

> Every time you make a meaningful change, you should commit it with a short message like:  
> `"Added image to homepage"`

---

### 3. **Push**
**Pushing** means sending your saved changes (commits) from your computer to GitHub.

---

### 4. **Pull**
**Pulling** means downloading any updates that were made on GitHub to your local project.

---

### 5. **Branch**
A **branch** is like a copy of your code that you can experiment on. You can test new features without messing up the main code.

> The main version of your project is usually on a branch called `main`.

---

### 6. **GitHub Pages**
This lets you **host a live website** using the code in your repo.

> Example:  
> If your GitHub username is `StephanieKoehl` and your repo is `my-site`, then:  
> `https://StephanieKoehl.github.io/my-site/` becomes your website!

## 💻 How It All Connects

1. You create a repository on GitHub.
2. You upload your project files.
3. You make changes and **commit** them.
4. You **push** those commits to GitHub.
5. GitHub **hosts your website** using GitHub Pages!
